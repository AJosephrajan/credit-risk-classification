# Assignmen -20 credit-risk-classification

Objective:

In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Steps for this Analysis:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

Credit Risk Analysis Report:

Explain the purpose of this analysis:
    The purpose of this analysis is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model that predicts the credity worthiness of potential borrowers from peer-to-peer lending services.

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

        Balanced Accuracy Score: 97.21% --> this means that when taking into account the sensitivity (recall and/or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the model, the balanced prediction accuracy was 97.21%
        Precision Score: 94% --> This means 94% of predicted positives were correct
        Recall Score: 97% --> this means that the model was 97% precise in measuring true positive values our of all positive predictions made.

Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.

       Based on the precision scores provided in the classification report, we can conclude that the model is doing a good job in making accurate positive predictions for both classes.
